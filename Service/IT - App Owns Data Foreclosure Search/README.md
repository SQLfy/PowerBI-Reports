**Usage / linkage of Foreclosure Search pbix reports to Dataset**  
![LineageView](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2591e60f-f7c7-42a3-be31-e27bf09ddf29)  
There was a duplicate of the Search report out on App Owns data (this is not an actual second report).  
The Details report page was referenced inside of Foreclosure Search so these were paired up.    
The Weekly Sales List was a separate pbix dataset with the report having the same display as the dataset.
This report was created as a direct query against the MDS source to enable real-time reporting.
